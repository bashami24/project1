In the first CASE statement, the MAX(NEW_REPORTED_COUNT) is calculated for each unique combination of CLAIM_NUMBER, EXPOSURE_PUBLICID_NK, CLAIM_SYMBOL_CODE, YEAR(CREATE_TIMESTAMP), and MONTH(CREATE_TIMESTAMP). This means that the MAX function is applied to the NEW_REPORTED_COUNT values for each group defined by these columns, grouped by the year and month of the CREATE_TIMESTAMP.

In the second CASE statement, the MAX(NEW_REOPENED_REPORTED_COUNT) is calculated for each unique combination of CLAIM_NUMBER, EXPOSURE_PUBLICID_NK, CLAIM_SYMBOL_CODE, YEAR(REOPEN_TIMESTAMP), MONTH(REOPEN_TIMESTAMP), and REOPEN_TIMESTAMP. This means that the MAX function is applied to the NEW_REOPENED_REPORTED_COUNT values for each group defined by these columns, grouped by the year, month, and REOPEN_TIMESTAMP of the REOPEN_TIMESTAMP.
