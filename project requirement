        Product Id (must be unique)
        Product Name
        Price
        Seller Name
    Seller

Create/Read functionality on Seller
    GET /seller/
        - All sellers
    POST /seller/
        - Seller names must be non-null & unique
CRUD functionality on Product
    GET /product/
        - All products
    GET /product/{id}
        - Get a single product
        - We should get a 404 error when we try to access a non-existed product.
    POST /product/ - Add a single product
        - Product ids should be non-null and unique
        - Product names should be non-null
        - Price should be over 0
        - Seller name should refer to an actually existing seller
    PUT /product/{id} - Update a single product
        - Product names should be non-null
        - Price should be over 0
        - Seller name should refer to an actually existing seller
    DELETE /product/{id} - Delete a single product
        - DELETE should always return 200, regardless of if the item existed
            at the start or not. This is convention.
