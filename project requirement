Two models:
    Product
        Product Id (must be unique)
        Product Name
        Price
        Seller Name
    Seller
        Seller Name (must be unique)

Create/Read functionality on Seller
    GET /seller/
        - All sellers
    POST /seller/
        - Seller names must be non-null & unique
CRUD functionality on Product
    GET /product/
        - All products
    GET /product/{id}
        - Get a single product
        - We should get a 404 error when we try to access a non-existed product.
    POST /product/ - Add a single product
        - Product ids should be non-null and unique
        - Product names should be non-null
        - Price should be over 0
        - Seller name should refer to an actually existing seller
    PUT /product/{id} - Update a single product
        - Product names should be non-null
        - Price should be over 0
        - Seller name should refer to an actually existing seller
    DELETE /product/{id} - Delete a single product
        - DELETE should always return 200, regardless of if the item existed
            at the start or not. This is convention.


The general structure of an HTML document consists of several parts, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a breakdown of the main parts:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML (in this case, HTML5). 
It is required at the beginning of every HTML document.

<html>: The root element of an HTML document. All other elements are nested inside this element.

<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the document title, character set, CSS styles, and scripts.
It does not display any content on the web page itself.

<meta>: Provides metadata about the HTML document, such as the character set, author, and viewport settings.
<title>: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab or title bar.
<link>: Links to external resources such as CSS stylesheets or icon files.
<script>: Links to or embeds JavaScript code.
<body>: Contains the main content of the HTML document, including text, images, links, and other elements 
that are displayed on the web page.

Text content: Paragraphs <p>, headings <h1> to <h6>, lists <ul>, <ol>, <li>, etc.
Structural elements: Divisions <div>, sections <section>, articles <article>, headers <header>, footers <footer>, etc.
Multimedia: Images <img>, videos <video>, audio <audio>, etc.
Links: Anchor tags <a> for creating hyperlinks.
Forms: Form elements <form>, input fields <input>, buttons <button>, etc.
Here's a simple example of an HTML document with the basic structure:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Sample HTML Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a sample HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
This document includes the essential parts of an HTML document: <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, 
and <body>. The <head> contains the document's metadata,
while the <body> contains the visible content displayed in the browser.
